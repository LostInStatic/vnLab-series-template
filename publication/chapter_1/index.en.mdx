summary: In Agnès Vardy's early, especially fictional films, death is an existential scandal for the protagonists - it comes out of nowhere, it is absurd, devoid of any sense and justification in a world where beauty and love are synonyms of life. Death appears to be something unthinkable or unimaginable in the strict sense, even if the protagonists have to - or only seemingly - confront it in an individual experience. In Szczęście (Le bonheur, 1965), the death (perhaps suicide) of one of the main characters is the only moment in which the intentionally artificial, overly cheerful and carefree tone of the film is briefly suspended - we see the corpse of a young, beautiful woman whose passing allows us to realize a male fantasy about the almost painless replacement of one woman by another, a wife by a mistress. Thus, dying is not a problem here, at best it deprives the survivors of the problem.

In Agnès Vardy's early, especially fictional films, death is an existential scandal for the protagonists - it comes out of nowhere, it is absurd, devoid of any sense and justification in a world where beauty and love are synonyms of life. Death appears to be something unthinkable or unimaginable in the strict sense, even if the protagonists have to - or only seemingly - confront it in an individual experience.

Thus, dying is not a problem here, at best it deprives the survivors of the problem. We do not find out what guided the heroine, and her struggle for life is reduced to micro-shots showing her how, while sinking, she grasps branches hanging over the water. It is only a small episode, a powerful, if only apparent, dramatic turn, which does not affect the continuity of the story or the harmony of the surrounding reality - and therefore it is a scandal.
