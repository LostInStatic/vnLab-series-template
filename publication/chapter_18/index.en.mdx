# *Kisieland*

In 2008, I began work on a special issue of my self-published periodical, *DIK Fagazine*. It was entirely devoted to the life of homosexuals in Central and Eastern Europe before 1989. While I was digging into the subject and searching for resources, I met many different people whom I then interviewed. This is how I came across Ryszard Kisiel, among others. At first I only knew that in the 1980s he had been publishing *Filo*, the first – half-legally distributed among friends – gay zine in this part of Europe. During subsequent meetings that took place at Kisiel’s home in Gdańsk, I had a chance to get acquainted with his extensive archive, which allowed me to discover new facts about the gay community of the period and learn about various aspects of his activities.
