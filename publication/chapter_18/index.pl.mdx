summary: In Agnès Vardy's early, especially fictional films, death is an existential scandal for the protagonists - it comes out of nowhere, it is absurd, devoid of any sense and justification in a world where beauty and love are synonyms of life. Death appears to be something unthinkable or unimaginable in the strict sense, even if the protagonists have to - or only seemingly - confront it in an individual experience. In Szczęście (Le bonheur, 1965), the death (perhaps suicide) of one of the main characters is the only moment in which the intentionally artificial, overly cheerful and carefree tone of the film is briefly suspended - we see the corpse of a young, beautiful woman whose passing allows us to realize a male fantasy about the almost painless replacement of one woman by another, a wife by a mistress. Thus, dying is not a problem here, at best it deprives the survivors of the problem.
