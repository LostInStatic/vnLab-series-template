has also argued that, while companies such as Keystone Views or Underwood and
Underwood published short pictorial groupings of stereograph cards organized
according to a narrative logic: “one sees clearly that the overall structure
was informed not by a narrative paradigm, but by the paradigm of the archive.
After all, the sequence could be rearranged; its temporality was indeterminate,
its narrativity relatively weak. The pleasures of this discourse were grounded
not in narrative necessarily, but in archival play, in substitution, and in a
voracious optical encyclopedism. There were always more images to be acquired,
obtainable at a price, from a relentlessly expanding, globally dispersed picture-gathering
agency.” Sekula, “The Body and the Archive,” op. cit., 58.
