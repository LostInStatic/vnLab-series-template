Wall-panel for “Appropriation and the Archive,” in _Haunted: Contemporary
Photography/Video/Performance_, Guggenheim Museum, March 26 to September
6, 2010. An earlier rehearsal of the same airily inflated conception of
“the archival impulse” had been offered in _Archive Fever: Uses of the
Document in Contemporary Art_, curated by Okwui Enwezor for the
International Center of Photography, January 18 to May 4, 2008. This
exhibition, described as a “widespread investigation” of “the archive as
both a conceptual and physical space in which memories are preserved and
history decided,” centered, in fact, once again, on “works by leading
contemporary artists who use photographic images to rethink the meaning of
identity, history, memory and loss.” Artists included Christian Boltanski,
Tacita Dean, Stan Douglas, Harun Farocki and Andrei Ujica, Felix
Gonzalez-Torres, Sherrie Levine, Robert Morris, Walid Raad, Thomas Ruff,
Fazal Sheikh, Lorna Simpson and, inevitably, Andy Warhol.
