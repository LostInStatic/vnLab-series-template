# The Archiving Machine. Or, The Camera and the Filing Cabinet

~For their comments and suggestions, I would like to thank audiences and colleagues at the Nasjonalbiblioteket, Oslo, The Hasselblad Foundation and the School of Photography of the University of Göteborg, The Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona in Tucson, the Archeology of Photography Foundation in Warsaw, and Binghamton University, New York.

<br />

Ancient as the Greeks, as it may be, it seems that “archive”––from _arkheion_, home of the _archon_ or magistrate and resting place of the records that preserve and pronounce the <Annotation target="law">See Jacques Derrida, _Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression_, trans. Eric Prenowitz (Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1996), 2–3.</Annotation>––is having its turn as one of those words, like “the body,” “visuality,” “hybridity,” “the aesthetic” and so on, that surge suddenly and sometimes surprisingly into fashion as the must-have accessory of the moment. And, for a time, they then become like brand names, the focus of intense loyalties and the object of impassioned exchanges understandable only to those who belong to the code.

<br />

This struck me again recently as I was entering an exhibition of contemporary photography, video and performance at the Guggenheim Museum and found myself following the crowd straight into a section labeled “Appropriation and the Archive.” The rubric was one of five “formal and conceptual <Annotation target="threads”">Jennifer Blessing and Nat Trotman, exhibition pamphlet for _Haunted: Contemporary Photography/Video/Performance_, Guggenheim Museum, March 26 to September 6, 2010, 1.</Annotation> around which the curators had organized their selection from what has become, by now, an institutionalized canon of recent work. “In the early 1960s,” the opening wall panel told us,

<Quote>
  Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol began to incorporate photographic images
  into their paintings, establishing a new mode of art making that relied not on
  the then-dominant tradition of gestural abstraction but rather on mechanical
  processes such as screenprinting. In doing so, they challenged the notion of
  art as the expression of a singular, heroic author and recast their works as
  repositories for information, be it autobiographical, cultural, or historical.
  This archiving impulse revolutionized art over the ensuing decades, paving the
  way for a conceptually driven use of photography as a means of absorbing the
  world at large into a new aesthetic{" "}

    Wall-panel for “Appropriation and the Archive,” in _Haunted: Contemporary
    Photography/Video/Performance_, Guggenheim Museum, March 26 to September 6,
    2010. An earlier rehearsal of the same airily inflated conception of “the
    archival impulse” had been offered in _Archive Fever: Uses of the Document
    in Contemporary Art_, curated by Okwui Enwezor for the International Center
    of Photography, January 18 to May 4, 2008. This exhibition, described as a
    “widespread investigation” of “the archive as both a conceptual and physical
    space in which memories are preserved and history decided,” centered, in
    fact, once again, on “works by leading contemporary artists who use
    photographic images to rethink the meaning of identity, history, memory and
    loss.” Artists included Christian Boltanski, Tacita Dean, Stan Douglas,
    Harun Farocki and Andrei Ujica, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Sherrie Levine,
    Robert Morris, Walid Raad, Thomas Ruff, Fazal Sheikh, Lorna Simpson and,
    inevitably, Andy Warhol.

The “archiving impulse,” the panel went on to suggest, had set off a train of art making intent on exploring “some of the possibilities encompassed by the idea that an artwork can serve as an <Annotation target="archive.”">Ibid.</Annotation> This insight, appropriated or misappropriated from a 2004 essay by Hal <Annotation target="Foster,">Hal Foster, “An Archival Impulse,” _October_, Vol. 110 (Fall 2004), 3–22.</Annotation> set the agenda for the opening section of the exhibition, in which the curators, effortlessly assimilating the repertoire of terms to which something once called Theory has now been reduced, set out to show that, though perceived at first “as a radical challenge to the status quo,” work in this archival mode, by artists such as Bernd and Hilla Becher, Sarah Charlesworth, Richard Prince and Cindy Sherman, can now, with hindsight, from the vantage point of the museum, be seen to describe a line of artistic development whose authentic markers are loss, trauma, remembrance, “a melancholic longing for an otherwise unrecuperable past,” and <Annotation target="death.">Blessing and Trotman, op. cit. In this, the Guggenheim curators depart from Foster who, in his discussion of the work of Thomas Hirschhorn, Tacita Dean and Sam Durant, concludes that the partial recovery of a utopian demand in their “archival art” “suggests a shift away from a melancholic culture that views the historical as little more than the traumatic.” Foster, op. cit., 22.</Annotation>

<br />

The curatorial language here is characteristically inert, drained of anything that might constitute a threat to the institution. It is a striking reversal from the time when Allan Sekula could write of “the shadowy presence of the archive” in the countless, neatly packed files, folders, drawers and shelves where, in the years between 1880 and 1910, “the archive became the dominant institutional basis for photographic <Annotation target="meaning.”">Allan Sekula, “The Body and the Archive,” _October_, Vol. 39 (Winter 1986), 57, 56.</Annotation> For Sekula and for some others at the end of the 1970s, amongst whom I would be included, the archival mode was a political apparatus inseparable from the rationalization of information, the control of bodies and the relegation of the photographic operator to “the status of a detail <Annotation target="worker.”">Sekula, ibid., 58.</Annotation> Something has clearly been lost, then, in the accommodation to the museum and the absorption of the impetus of theory into the steady institutionalization of a hardly varied canon. This may be reason enough to try to go back to recover something of the edge and point of the original arguments thirty years ago. But the issue of the archive is also as pressing now as it ever was in the nineteenth century. So, before we try to distance the archive’s effects as endlessly fraught by melancholy and the uncanny, perhaps we should try to encounter its machinery in the full force and confidence of its operation as an apparatus of rationalization and social management––an instrumental machine that, in grasping and appropriating photography, not only absorbed the individual operator as a mere extension of its mechanism but also subsumed the camera and its peripherals, radically complicating our sense of what can be said to constitute the photographic apparatus.

This process began early––and not in some airless basement room of a department of the State, as one might suspect. It was always more domesticated than that. So let us start in the drawing room or, perhaps, a gentleman’s library––a gentleman like Oliver Wendell Holmes.

<br />

It was in 1859 that the American physician, essayist, poet and inventor published the first of his unrestrained paeans to the stereoscope and the stereograph; though, at the time, he may not, perhaps, have entirely intended his readers to think he had given himself over to hyperbole––not even in that Baudrillardean moment when he declared the world of mere matter to have been overwhelmed, stripped of its forms and rendered redundant by the triumph of stereoscopic <Annotation target="simulation."> Oliver Wendell Holmes, “The Stereoscope and the Stereograph,” _Atlantic Monthly_ (June 1859), 738–48; excerpted in _Classic Essays on Photography_, ed. Alan Trachtenberg (New Haven, Connecticut: Leete’s Island Books, 1980), 71–82. See also Oliver Wendell Holmes, “Sun-Painting and Sun-Sculpture,” _Atlantic Monthly_, Vol. VIII (July 1861); and “Doings of the Sunbeam,” _Atlantic Monthly_, Vol. XII (July 1863): 1–15.</Annotation> Whatever we make of this, as an avid collector of stereocards, as the inventor of a popular hand-held viewer and as a vocal advocate of stereographic libraries, Holmes also knew with rather more certainty that those little card mounts with their two almost identical images threatened to overwhelm in an entirely different and more mundane way.

<br />

Just a few years earlier, between 1854 and 1856, following the successful showing of stereographs at London’s Great Exhibition, the London Stereoscopic Company alone had produced and sold half a million stereoscopic images from an inventory that, by 1859, listed 100,000 different stereoscopic views. After 1857, as card mounted paper prints of stereoscopic wet-plate negatives began to prevail, these lucrative parlor novelties were mass produced in their millions, reaching a peak of popularity in the early decades of the twentieth century through the astute marketing strategies of such corporations as the Keystone View Company and Underwood and Underwood. Holmes took the inexhaustible exactness and “infinite charm” of stereographic images to be key to their hold on <Annotation target="viewers."> Holmes, “The Stereoscope and the Stereograph,” in _Classic Essays on Photography_, 77.</Annotation> Yet we may ask if this was enough. Clearly publishers’ warehouses would have been overwhelmed and their retail outlets reduced to unprofitable chaos if the technology of the binocular camera had not also been harnessed to another more modest yet equally exacting machinery: the comparatively understudied technology of the cabinet, with its labeled drawers, card dividers, titles, captions and that felicitous accompaniment, the catalogue, whose subject headings, subheadings and thematic sets served to organize both the logic of production and the drives of consumer desire.

<br />

If Holmes saw the shock-value of the stereograph as “an appearance of reality which cheats the senses with its seeming truth” as “the mind feels its way into the very depths of the <Annotation target="picture,”"> Ibid., 74 and 77.</Annotation> he himself knew that the photograph’s mechanism of capture could not operate so irresistibly if not embedded in the entirely non-mimetic machinery of the catalogue and the file. As early as 1859, Holmes foresaw that the consequence of the proliferation of stereoscopic images “will soon be such enormous collections of forms that they will have to be classified and arranged in vast libraries, as books are <Annotation target="now.”"> Ibid., 81.</Annotation> This moved him to call for “the creation of a comprehensive and systematic stereographic library,” indeed, for a chain of libraries at what he called the city, the national and the Imperial <Annotation target="levels."> Ibid., 81.</Annotation> Yet, even in the rather less grandiose spaces of the drawing room, church hall and schoolroom, where the stereograph made its more certain home, some sort of technology of storage and retrieval and some sort of system of classification and arrangement were equally wanting. So it was that the more or less elaborate stereoscopic viewer came quite habitually to be found alongside another equally important piece of furniture providing a means of organizing and housing the collection, often in an order shaped by the sets and series of the manufacturer’s catalogue, which, demanding completion as they did, continually re-incited the consumer’s desire while giving the profitable little commodities the aura of something more than mere entertainment.

Even on this homely plane, therefore, the cabinet, case or humble shoe-box marked the semantic space in which the singularity of the view was inserted into a more complex representation of the world that, in its aspirations at least, offered a glimpse of a kind of topographical encyclopedia whose organization betrayed a whole geographical system. For, as Rosalind Krauss has written:

<Quote>
  The file cabinet is very different as an object from the wall or the easel. It
  holds out the possibility of storing and cross-referencing bits of information
  and of collating them through the particular grid of a system of knowledge.
  The elaborate cabinets of stereo views that were part of the furnishing of
  nineteenth-century middle-class homes as well as of the equipment of public
  libraries comprise a compound representation of geographic space. The
  spatiality of the view, its insistent penetration, functions, then, as the
  sensory model for a more abstract system whose subject is also space. View and
  land survey are interdetermined and{" "}

    Rosalind Krauss, “Photography’s Discursive Spaces: Landscape/View,” _Art
    Journal_, Vol. 42, No. 4, The Crisis in the Discipline (Winter, 1982), 315.
    Allan Sekula has also argued that, while companies such as Keystone Views or
    Underwood and Underwood published short pictorial groupings of stereograph
    cards organized according to a narrative logic: “one sees clearly that the
    overall structure was informed not by a narrative paradigm, but by the
    paradigm of the archive. After all, the sequence could be rearranged; its
    temporality was indeterminate, its narrativity relatively weak. The
    pleasures of this discourse were grounded not in narrative necessarily, but
    in archival play, in substitution, and in a voracious optical encyclopedism.
    There were always more images to be acquired, obtainable at a price, from a
    relentlessly expanding, globally dispersed picture-gathering agency.”
    Sekula, “The Body and the Archive,” op. cit., 58.

Already, then, we are dealing with something more than merely a means of coping with the problem of over-accumulation, though this remained the persistent challenge of the developing photographic economy as, in a short span of years, it modeled the evolution of capitalist production from artisanal to entrepreneurial and then on to fully corporate forms. A trade card from the mid 1860s advertising the Paris photographic studio of Xavier Mérieux encapsulates this threat: the camera has become a production machine spewing forth a stream of commodities in such a promise of profusion that the somewhat consternated operator seems, like the Sorcerer’s Apprentice, to be in danger of being entirely submerged if the other cameras follow suit and the stream becomes a deluge.

<br />

This danger was also felt by the architects of those great accumulations of instrumental images that began to be assembled, in sporadic ways, from the mid 1850s on but at an accelerated pace after 1870. As Alphonse Bertillon, director of the Identification Bureau of the Paris Prefecture of Police and inventor of the first scientific system for cataloguing and retrieving photographic records, protested in 1891:

<Quote>
  The collection of criminal portraits has already attained a size so
  considerable that it has become physically impossible to discover among them
  the likeness of an individual who has assumed a false name. It goes for
  nothing that in the past ten years the Paris police have collected more than
  100,000 photographs. Does the reader believe it practicable to compare
  successively each of these with each one of the 100 individuals who are
  arrested daily in Paris? When this was attempted in the case of a criminal
  particularly easy to identify, the search demanded more than a week of
  application, not to speak of the errors and oversights which a task so
  fatiguing to the eye could not fail to{" "}

    11, no. 3 (May 1891), 331.

If the professional criminal’s mastery of disguises, false identities, alibis and multiple biographies was to be broken and if the early promise of photography as a means of detection was not to wither in the face of a massive and chaotic accumulation of images, what was needed, Bertillon argued, was “a method of elimination analogous to that in use in botany and zoology; that is to say, one based on the characteristic elements of <Annotation target="individuality.”">Ibid., 331.</Annotation> For such a system, the integration of precisely standardized photographs with systematized anthropometric measurements and a refined physiognomic vocabulary provided the foundation, but the problem of classification was paramount. Only by inserting his individual signaletic cards into a statistically grounded system of organization was Bertillon able to file 100,000 records in a comprehensive grid of file-drawers from which records could be retrieved quickly and effectively, with a minimum expenditure of labour.

<br />

As Allan Sekula has argued, Bertillon was “one of the first users of photographic documents to comprehend fully the fundamental problem of the archive, the problem of <Annotation target="volume.”">Sekula, “The Body and the Archive,” 29.</Annotation> It is indeed at this time that, as Sekula has also pointed out, leading office furniture companies such as Yawman and Erbe of Rochester, New York, began not only to produce Bertillon cabinets for criminal identification but also to manufacture ledger systems, card record holders, business files and library card-catalogue cabinets, promoting their products through the publication of primers in business studies such as the classic _Modern Filing and How To File: A Textbook on Office System_, with its chapters on vertical filing, methods of indexing, card record systems and stock record <Annotation target="keeping.">Sekula, ibid., 57. See also: W. D. Wigent, Burton D. Housel and E. Harry Gilman, _Modern Filing and How To File: A Textbook on Office System_ (Rochester, NY: Yarman and Erbe Manufacturing Company, 1916).</Annotation> There is clearly a wider process of technological dissemination at play here and its consequences are considerable.

<br />

These consequences began to unfold as, in the very period in which mass-produced dry plates and accessible hand-held cameras also became widely available, the archiving of photographs came to play a more and more central role in an expanding array of disciplinary institutions and empirical disciplines, ranging from psychiatry and medicine to art history and military intelligence. If Bertillon had demonstrated the utility of his model for policing the mobile population of the modern city, then other disciplines too faced equally challenging problems in cataloguing accumulations of photographs that threatened to overwhelm. Once again, the issue was not only one of storage and retrieval. The categorical system of the instrumental archive was also absolutely central to its knowledge effect. This was the promise of the photographic archive. And, while its realization seemed to be grounded on the technical refinement of strictly optical technologies, it was clear that the archiving lens only produced its disciplinary effects when integrated into a larger ensemble: a bureaucratic, clerical system whose central artifact was not primarily the camera but rather the filing cabinet.

<br />

Though baffling to us now perhaps, what we encounter, right into the early years of the twentieth century, is an over-brimming enthusiasm for this new information technology, “the modern vertical file.” Invented in 1892 and first displayed at the Chicago World’s Fair the following year, the vertical file was still being hailed more than twenty years later as an instrument for organizing and handling archives that is “as near an approach to the ideal as can reasonably be <Annotation target="expected.”">H. D. Gower, L. Stanley Jast and W. W. Topley, _The Camera as Historian_ (London: Sampson Low, Marston and Co., Ltd., 1916), 85.</Annotation> This is the view of H. D. Gower, L. Stanley Jast and W. W. Topley, past and presiding officers of the Photographic Survey and Record of Surrey and authors of the indispensable “handbook to photographic record <Annotation target="work,”">Ibid., iii.</Annotation> _The Camera as Historian_. For Gower, Jast and Topley, while the meaning of the actual record photograph could be taken as read in little more than two pages and a single strategic plate, more than a third of their book’s two hundred and sixty pages demanded to be given over to the really engaging questions of storage: the relative merits of boxes, drawers and vertical files; the mount and the mounting process; the masking and binding of lantern slides; the label; the “contributors’ <Annotation target="schedules;”">Ibid., 71</Annotation> the quality of marking ink; the decimal system of classification and the subject index; the method of Ordnance map referencing; vertical file guides and their proper use; and the importance of the secretary’s Register of Prints.

<br />

></ViewportImage>

As in the case of Bertillon, what concerned Gower, Jast and Topley was that, as the number of photographic survey records grew, it was clearly impossible to handle them or access their collective record without an expandable system of storage and without what they called a “proper <Annotation target="arrangement">Ibid., 94.</Annotation>,” by which they meant “a systematic <Annotation target="order.”">Ibid., 96-7. It is worth noting that, of the authors, L. Stanley Jast was Deputy Chief Librarian of Manchester Public Libraries and Hon. Secretary of the Library Association, while W. W. Topley was a member of Croydon Libraries Committee. For the influence of bibliographical science on photographic archive organization, see Allan Sekula, “The Body and the Archive,” 56-7.</Annotation> It was this that the “modern vertical file” made possible. Like the paradigm in Saussure’s linguistics, the structure of the filing cabinet and the classificatory order it supported determined the system of substitutions and equivalences within which the photographic signs were disposed. But, as in the Saussurean model itself, the construction of meaning across this structure of differences could not but radically conflict with the notion of meaning as a fullness interior to the sign––a notion nowhere more firmly entrenched than in relation to the photograph. In the annals of the Survey and Record, the photograph’s function as history turned not just on the fixed yet empty indexical relation to the singularity of a temporal moment but on its relation to the machinery of the archive––a machinery in which its relation to time was endlessly displaced across an infinity of temporal vectors: the time the machinery took to work, as well as the temporizing linkages and distinctions it constructed. As a result, the primacy of the camera and the indexical realism of the print were unwittingly but effectively displaced, suggesting that Gower, Jast and Topley––formalists in their hearts––might better have titled their work: _The Filing Cabinet as Historian_.

We are, it seems, in the world of Borges’s Library of Babel, structured like the system of a language in its infinite <Annotation target="extension.">Jorge Luis Borges, “The Library of Babel,” in _Ficciones_, Anthony Kerrigan [ed.], trans. Anthony Bonner (New York: Grove Press, 1962). The story originally appeared in Borges’s 1941 collection of stories _El Jardín de senderos que se bifurcan_ (_The Garden of Forking Paths_), which was incorporated into the collection _Ficciones_ (Buenos Aires: Editorial Sur, 1944). In _All The Names_ (1997), José Saramago also writes of the inescapable incompletion of the archive, undone not only by error, decay and the work of unseen parasites but by the fallibility of its very system, marking, in Saramago’s terms, the triumph of sense over meaning, irresolvability over instrumentalization, irreducible difference over absolute fixity and the bureaucratic closure of the State. See José Saramago, _All The Names_, trans. Margaret Jull Costa (New York: Harcourt, 1999).</Annotation> But it was only in the bureaucratic imagination that the “modern vertical file” of the Survey and Record could be seen as functioning like an ideal language system. In itself, that system could never escape its structural incompletion, marked by the fatal shafts of emptiness that pierce the architecture of Borges’s library. But beyond this, we have also learnt from Foucault that the space of the file is the space of a disciplinary machine: an apparatus for individuation and categorization; an instrument for regulating bodies, territories and knowledge, rendering them the object of technocratic adjudication.

<br />

Yet, as a _technology of history_, the filing cabinet of the Survey and Record has also to accommodate two further, paradoxical, concerns: a concern for the time history takes to function and the labour it expends (which in the logic of Capital amount in the end to the same thing); and a concern for the durability of history, for its duration and resilience and for the survival of history itself against the erosions of time. On the one hand, the soundly constructed cabinet offered a means to prolong the shelf life of history. On the other, at least in the imaginary of empiricism and the dream economy of information handling, its rigid structure held out the promise of closing the circuit of reading-sign-referent, which is here hardly separable from the circuit production-consumption-profit. Already, then, in Gower, Jast and Topley’s cumbersome wood, brass and cardboard computer, far short of the “real-time” technologies of Google and CNN, the time of history is imagined as approaching the ideal zero time of disciplinary knowledge and the cycle of Capital: “exchange in the least possible time (‘real’ time) for the greatest possible time (‘abstract’ or lost <Annotation target="time).”">Jean-François Lyotard, The Differend: Phrases in Dispute, trans. Georges Van Den Abbeele (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1988), section 251, 177.</Annotation> Always assuming, of course, that the technology will work smoothly and ergonomically, without wastage or malfunction.

<br />

We would do well, however, to be suspicious of this fantasy of an inexorable archival machine, beloved as it may be to conspirers and conspiracy theorists alike. In the first place, as Robin Kelsey has amply shown in relation to the place of Timothy O’Sullivan’s photographs in the files and reports of Wheeler’s Geographical Exploration and Survey West of the 100th Meridian, the archive may be ruled by an internal logic that governs the production of its events of meaning but it is still a logic whose play allows for variation, transformation and even a skeptical <Annotation target="reflexivity.">Robin E. Kelsey, “Viewing the Archive: Timothy O’Sullivan’s Photographs for the Wheeler Survey,” _The Art Bulletin_, Vol. LXXXV, No. 4 (December 2003): 702–723. See also: Robin E. Kelsey, _Archive Style: Photographs and Illustrations for U.S. Surveys, 1850-1890_ (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007).</Annotation> In large part, of course, this play is only a consequence of the fact that the logic of instrumentalization is not given but has to be articulated and instituted, so that, at least potentially, the drive to close the semantic circuit of the archive is always open at every point to resistance and contestation. Granting this, however, what may in actuality be more telling and significant is that the circuit is never finally able to secure itself, so that the functioning of the archive––meaning the signification of the evidential document and the computation of the archiving system––is always both excessive and inadequate in relation to itself: the instrumentalized record is always simultaneously too big and too small for its discursive frame, saying less than is wished and more than is wanted.

The cropping out of this excess and inadequacy, in order to ensure that meaning falls readily and squarely into place, is the work of what I take to be a kind of violence that is brutal enough in its own ways. Yet, it would clearly be wrong to suggest that the repression of the internal incoherence and final indeterminacy of archival systems is all that holds their remorseless effects of power/knowledge in place. The collapse of police states and regimes of terror around the world in the past twenty years has shown us this much, in the context of a striking reversal. In the erstwhile German Democratic Republic, in post-Ceausescu Romania, in Argentina after the Dirty War, and in Cambodia after the fall of the Khmer Rouge, archives have been recovered from ransacked offices, water-logged barns, prison camps and garbage dumps and, with patient forensic archaeology and conservation, turned around so that they have begun to speak again, this time of the guilt of the interrogators, torturers, executioners, spies and informers for whom the pervasive archive was an infinitely elaborated map laid point by point on the world––a map that, in a frightening inversion of another of Borges’s fictional meditations, soaked up the fluid life of the world itself, leaving it desiccated, shriveled, tattered and drained of <Annotation target="blood.">Cf., Jorge Luis Borges, “On Exactitude in Science,” in _A Universal History of Infamy_, trans. Norman Thomas de Giovanni (London: Penguin Books, 1975). The story was first published under the name B. Lynch Davis in the March 1946 edition of _Los Anales de Buenos Aires_, año 1, no. 3, as part of a piece called “Museo” in which it was cited as a quotation from “Suarez Miranda, Viajes de varones prudentes, Libro IV, Cap. XLV, Lerida, 1658.” The story was collected later that year in the 1946 second Argentine edition of Borges’s _Historia Universal de la Infamia_.</Annotation> Even in the United States, secret stores of tapes, the files of hundreds of thousands of deleted e-mails and, more recently of course, a cache of countless diplomatic cables have emerged again as counter-archives of all that has been cynically kept from view––all that has been politically cleansed from the so-called public record, which, in its official and media forms, has become little more than a flickering shadow theatre for the entrancement of the infantilized.

<br />

Archives still retain, therefore, a particular and perhaps privileged relation to the field of truth. Yet this relationship is always framed by the larger machinery of governmentality that works, in part, as Foucault has shown, by demarcating boundaries between the true and the false, by mobilizing them and by bringing them to bear, not least on the differential relations to truth within which designated subject positions are distinguished and defined. In the space of the archive, therefore, the politics of truth inevitably folds into a politics of identity, through the regulation of relationships to time, truth and memory and to the practices and technologies of record and recollection. As a result, while the archive may once have seemed destined for invisibility in the anonymity of its functioning, the forces of self-determination, decolonization and their counter movements have made it a highly politicized space, as communities have come to be seen as being made and remade through the sharing of the ethical obligation of remembrance and through the claim to “collective memory,” of which the archive is now seen as the <Annotation target="repository.">The concept of “collective memory” was first coined in 1925 by the French sociologist and pupil of Durkheim, Maurice Halbwachs. See Maurice Halbwachs, _On Collective Memory_ (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992); translated from _Les cadres sociaux de la mémoire_ (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1952), originally published in _Les Travaux de L'Année Sociologique_ (Paris: F. Alcan, 1925). For the notion of “the ethics of memory,” see Avishai Margalit, _The Ethics of Memory_ (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2002).</Annotation> The very existence of an archive has come to be viewed as constitutive of a community’s claim to identity and what should be in the archive, who should adjudicate it and who should have access to it have become questions of urgent social and political significance. A striking example of this is Susan Meiselas’s extraordinary historical and pedagogic work in the divided territories of Kurdistan, aiming precisely “to build a collective memory with a people who have no national <Annotation target="archive.”">See Susan Meiselas, _Kurdistan: In The Shadow Of History_ (New York: Random House, 1997) and the web-site akaKURDISTAN a place for collective memory and cultural exchange (http://www.akakurdistan.com/) (visited 8 September 2010).</Annotation>

<br />

Across the political field, therefore, the archive has become central to the political construction of community and identity, just as memory studies have, since the 1980s, come to dominate academic engagements with photography, displacing the earlier concern with the politics of representation that marked the emergence of photo theory in the <Annotation target="1970s.">On this, see Jonathan Long and Edward Welch’s introduction to J. J. Long, Andrea Noble and Edward Welch [eds], _Photography: Theoretical Snapshots_ (London and New York: Routledge, 2009).</Annotation> What seems to be called for now––all the more so in the face of attempts by Google, Monsanto and others to capitalize and dispossess the commons of <Annotation target="knowledge">On the central function of “accumulation by dispossession” in contemporary capitalism, see David Harvey, _The Enigma of Capital: And the Crises of Capitalism_ (London: Profile, 2010).</Annotation>––is not just an archaeology of the archive but a counter-practice framed within another politics. Yet there remains a danger in this, insofar as it conjures up a vision of the archive as a human right, just as it invites the thought to persist that truth is in the archive––even a counter-truth. What such a thought leaves intact is the intransigent function of the archive itself as a machinery of truth, a computer of everything that is the case––each case, of course, duly recorded, documented, numbered, filed and secreted away in drawers, cabinets, drives, databases and servers. For, in the archive of everything, something can be the case only insofar as it is subject to the entire apparatus. But what is an apparatus?

<br />

The archival apparatus we are talking about is a composite machine––a kind of computer––in which, as we have seen, the camera, with its less than efficient chemical coding system, is hooked up to that other great nineteenth-century invention, the upright file. Here we have it: the One-Eyed Man and the One-Armed Man of Deleuze and Guattari, conjoining magical capture and legislative subjection as the axiomatic processes of a new information technology that rules the public and regulatory functions of the <Annotation target="archive.">See Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, _A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia_, trans. Brian Massumi (Minneapolis and London: University of Minnesota Press, 1987), especially Chapter 13, “7000 B.C.: Apparatus of Capture,” 424–73.</Annotation> But this already suggests that an apparatus is not just a matter of machinery. It is rather, as Michel Foucault stressed, a specific strategic knot of technologies, discourses, legislative frameworks, coercions and enforcements that constitutes a network of practices and relations of power and that generates a positive field of <Annotation target="knowledge.">Michel Foucault, “The Confessions of the Flesh,” in _Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972–77_, Colin Gordon [ed.] (New York: Pantheon Books, 1980), 194–96.</Annotation> It is, therefore, at once, a discursive machinery and a discursive economy––a circuitry whose mode of operation for Agamben and Lacan, as for Deleuze and Guattari, is _capture_.

Capture is the name given to the plane of emergence of that third modality in Foucault’s technology of power/knowledge: the subject––defined succinctly by Giorgio Agamben, in his commentary on Foucault, as the product of the conflictual relations between and among beings and <Annotation target="apparatuses.">Giorgio Agambern, _What Is An Apparatus? And Other Essays_, trans. David Kishik and Stefan Pedatella (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2009), 14.</Annotation> Agamben, however, is also quick to point out that subjectification is not a singular process of concentration and condensation but rather a process of multiplication and dissemination, enacted in third-stage Capitalism as a process of non-identical accumulation now almost commonly embraced by its acolytes as the so-called openness of postmodern identity. Agamben prefers to say that the proliferation and accumulation of contemporary power has accelerated and multiplied the process of capture and subjectification to the point where identity is an interminable series of separations through which the apparatus instrumentalizes and, in the same movement, capitalizes being as subjection. There is, then, Agamben insists, no question of redeeming this process by a civic vigilance aimed at using the apparatus correctly. Those who advocate this, he says, are merely speaking for the apparatus that has captured <Annotation target="them.">Ibid., 21.</Annotation>

<br />

It is a trenchant argument and we might well heed Agamben’s warning before proposing that the apparatus of the archive can be redeemed and rendered pure by a civic-minded watchfulness. The view we may derive from Agamben would seem to be like the one that Lenin once held about the State apparatus, at least before seizing power: The archive too cannot be taken over but has to be smashed.

<br />

To say this––under the shelter of the archive itself, as scholarship always is–– may seem churlish and perverse. Yet the point of invoking and extending Agamben’s cautionary critique is to make us ask what we have lost of our being to archival machines––just as, nearer to home, it may also make us wary of what one might call “the archival turn” in scholarship over the past ten or fifteen years, by which I mean the turn to the archive as the ground of historical recovery and the starting point for scholarly research grown weary both of Modernist historicism and of the kind of Theory for which the historical text is only, at best, an allegory of its own modes of operation. We might contrast this with the equally recent discovery of the archive as itself an object of study––indeed, for the history of photography, an essential and inescapable object of study. These two turns towards the archive are not at all the same kind of thing. For the one, the archive is not only given but is the frame of knowledge production itself. For the other, the archive has to be constituted as an object of knowledge whose workings are part of the historical and indeed political problem. Here, then, is a very different sense in which, not least for histories of photographies, one might say that the archive must and must not be the horizon of our future thought.
